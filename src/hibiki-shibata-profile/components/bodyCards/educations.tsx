            <blockquote>
                I pursued a general curriculum with a strong focus on the sciences, including Mathematics, Physics,
                Chemistry, Biology, Computer Science, and English. Throughout my studies, I consistently achieved top
                academic performance, ranking within the top 10 out of approximately 400 students, with an average
                placement
                of 5th overall. I demonstrated particular strength in Geography, Physics, and Japanese, often achieving
                the
                highest scores in the entire student body.
                Through consistent hard work and academic excellence across all subjects, I graduated with honors.
