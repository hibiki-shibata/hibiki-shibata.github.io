                    In this role, I led the transition of the division from a Japan-local operation to integration with the
                    Global team, taking ownership of internal technical support across a wide range of systems and tools.
                    While
                    fulfilling the responsibilities of technical support, I went beyond typical Help Desk duties by actively
                    developing internal tools and microservices (using TypeScript, Python, Docker, and more) to automate
                    tasks
                    and improve operational efficiency.

                    I collaborated closely with global product teams, including software engineers and product leads,
                    handling a
                    broad spectrum of issues from technical troubleshooting to supporting compliance and legal data
                    requests. My
                    daily work required strong technical analysis skills, direct system investigations, and SQL-based data
                    operations.

                    Operating mainly in English, I developed a natural fluency in communicating across multicultural teams.
                    In
                    short, my role served as a technical bridge between business operations and the product engineering
                    teams,
                    enabling smoother collaboration and more efficient workflows through both support and self-driven
                    software
                    development initiatives.

                    I joined Wolt as a Support Associate immediately after graduating, initially with the goal of saving for
                    future university studies. In this full-time role, I was responsible for supporting both customers and
                    company partners, managing a wide range of inquiries, resolving issues, and facilitating effective
                    communication between all parties.

                    Over time, through exposure to Wolt’s culture and talent—particularly within the Product+ organization—I
                    developed a strong interest in the technology and product development space. Motivated and inspired by
                    the
                    work of the Product+ team, I decided to pursue a more technical career path within the company,
                    ultimately
                    applying for and transitioning into a role where I could contribute using my technical skills.
